# flutter_complete_guide

## Purpose

The purpose of me learning how to create Flutter applications is to build my portfolio. That way when people ask me to build them an app or a website, I am well prepared. The Flutter mobile app will correspond with my personal brand - that means it will complement my web app that I plan to build with Wix.

I plan to use Wix to build my new personal app because most of the time people want me to build their website, I will use a development tool such as Wix. It is time to put my pride to the side so that I can make quality websites for my future clients. They will not be disappointed.

## About Flutter
Flutter can be ran on any of the following operating systems:
- iOS
- Windows
- macOS
- Android
- Linux
- web

The operating system I will choose for this project is iOS. The operating system I choose to develop for is called the "development target". iOS is my development target.

## Flutter Setup
Necessary software:
- Git
- Visual Studio Code

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Android SDK Setup

Path to Android SDK:
C:\Users\kirkp\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk

Environment variable in Path to use sdkmanager:
C:\Users\kirkp\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\cmdline-tools\latest\bin

Of course the `username` (i.e. kirkp) will change based on which local computer I'm on, but the format should be generally similar.

We need a Java 8 download as well.

## Resources

I took the `main.dart` from my instructor, Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's, source code. As well as the `pubspec.yaml` file.

## Help

In Visual Studio Code, press `Shift + F5`, or click `Run` in the toolbar, then click `Run without debugging` in order to get live updates to the Android emulator changes when the code is saved.
